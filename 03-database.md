# MySQL

* Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

* **Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.**

Install MySQL Server 8.0.x

```shell
dnf install mysql-server -y
```

Start MySQL Service

```shell
systemctl enable mysqld
```

```shell
systemctl start mysqld
```

* Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password ExpenseApp@1 or any other as per your choice.

```shell
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
```
That's all
